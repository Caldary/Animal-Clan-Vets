### Vet Management App

A veterinary practice has approached you to build a web application to help them manage their animals and vets. A vet may look after many animals at a time. An animal is registered with only one vet. 

#### MVP

- The practice wants to be able to register / track animals. Important information for the vets to know is -
  - Name
  - Date Of Birth (use a VARCHAR initially)
  - Type of animal
  - Contact details for the owner
  - Treatment notes
- Be able to assign animals to vets
- CRUD actions for vets / animals - remember the user - what would they want to see on each View? What Views should there be?

### Possible Extensions

- If an owner has multiple animals we don't want to keep updating contact details separately for each pet. Extend your application to reflect that an owner can have many pets and to more sensibly keep track of owners' details (avoiding repetition / inconsistencies)
- Sometimes vets are called in for consultations on pets in another vet's care. Record these consultations and enable the practice to see useful info e.g. all the vets a pet has been seen by.
- Handle check-in / check-out dates
- Let the practice see all animals currently in the practice (today's date is between the check-in and check-out?)
- Sometimes an owner does not know the DOB. Allow them to enter an age instead. Try and make sure this always up to date - ie if they visit again a year from now a 3 yr old dog is now 4.
- Add extra functionality of your choosing - assigning treatments, a more comprehensive way of maintaining treatment notes over time. Appointments. Pricing / billing.
